# portfolio

All of the requirements have been fufilled. And this assignment has been keeping me honest in terms of brushing off my css skill and making sure I have website after this course is over.

Updated Resume, updated CV, updated github with projects and new assignments. Also, this is a new and dedicated portfolio github. New readme as seen here. Everything is good.

Styling with CSS remains my weakest parts of my coding so far as I dealt with a hurricane throughout that part. I am going to work on this part throughout the weekend.

But I believe I've done enough more than pass this assignment.
